# Vending Machine

ADP(Project 3): A non-interface and usable vending machine in Javascript. It uses describe and it to

The task for your coding interview is to implement a vending machine in JavaScript.

The vending machine itself should be a Javascript class. You do not need to write an interface for using the vending machine, just tests to prove that it works.

Contain at least 10 well-formed, passing tests
Contain a reasonably DRY (don't repeat yourself) implementation, though the tests can be verbose
Use describe and it correctly so the test output specifically describes the behaviour of the code
Have a screenshot in the repository's README.md of the test output from the terminal
Use a ES2015 class to build the vending machine
Print vending machine inventory
Refill vending machine inventory
Re-supply vending machine change
Dispense inventory based on payment
Return change as coins (e.g. \$0.35 is 1 quarter and 1 dime)
